Use Cases
-These aren't use cases, a use case should account for an entire 'visit' to the website rather than what they can do. Will update with a better example soon. -Trevin

	-Don't see this as something we need since I rarely see sites give the ability to change this. Could lead to problems ~Travis
	-This is because most use usernames as primary keys within their database alongside email adresses, as long as we require an email, this really isn't a problem. Also we should probably put this in a google doc instead to make commenting easier. -Trevin
